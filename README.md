## Neighbourhood Map Udacity Project

To run the application, clone the repository to your computer and open the index.html file in your browser.

## Using the application

A full screen Google Map will appear in your browser along with 5 unique map markers. Each of these markers 
corresponds to a location listed at the top of the page in the blue header section. When you click on a location 
name, its map marker will bounce. When you click on a marker, it will bounce and open an information window 
which contains the 'city' location of the venue according to the 1st record known to Foursquare via its API. 

You may filter down the list of locations by using the search bar also located at the top of the page. Each time 
you enter a character into this search bar, the list will remove any locations which do not match this character 
string.
